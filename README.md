This project involved refactoring code for a digital marketing agency. While multiple changes were made, the integrity of the original code was kept, while creating a cleaner code. Changes included making comments to CSS and HTML, adding id tags for appropriate link format, and adding alt tags to images for accessability purposes. 
Condensing of CSS code was attempted, but not successful. CSS was reformatted to match the flow of the page.
